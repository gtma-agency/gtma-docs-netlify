### Overview 

The basics of Online Video ADA compliance includes:

1. Videos should have closed captions for deaf and hard-of hearing viewers. Captions are accurate, complete, and time-synced with the speech. Relevant sound effects get described (music, doorbells, noises that make an impact to the story)
2. Include audio descriptions and transcripts for blind users (the script, basically)
3. Make sure your media player has keyboard-operable controls (which is covered by accessibe)

ADA rules and regulations could change with any lawsuit, but videos are pretty straightforward and captions have been around for a long time.

### Possible Approaches

## Using a free editor:

* Amara.org
* DotSub.com
* Subtitle Horse 

This is faster, but offers less control and may miss words and sound effects.

## Custom editing
Use tools within Premiere Pro or video editing tools to create your custom captions which include text design/formatting that matches the brand and the theme of the video and is synced to the speech. 

Here is a video of someone doing that in Adobe Premiere Pro in less than 20 minutes.
