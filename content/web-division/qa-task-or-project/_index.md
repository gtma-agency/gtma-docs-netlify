### Before sending to QA the Dev should follow these steps

This will be for projects that are not full site builds but are more complex than a single task. Modifications to legacy projects are tricky and prone to negative side-effects. Be mindful of this and ensure that our work doesn't adversely affect existing functionality.

Before marking as complete:

1. Review the original task/spec
2. Confirm that what was done meets the task/spec
3. Test for possible side-effects and ensure backward compatibility with existing code
4. Design
5. Functionality
6. Performance (if applicable)
7. Security (if applicable)
8. Test in multiple browsers/mobile
9. Reassign task to someone else to do QA

### Task QA (Done by a third-party)
