### Current Site Pain Points

What is your current site doing that drives you nuts?

### Post Launch

_It may seem odd to ask this in a pre-sales call, but this makes a huge difference in how we build the site_

The client has to live with what we build! Unless we're doing all of the content management for the client, we're delivering a tool that they will be implemented in their environment to achieve their goals. Acknowledging this up front allows us to set the tone that we're willing to partner with them for the long haul, this is not a commodity that we will deliver and wash our hands of, and launching this project is the beginning of something, not the end.

Who will be managing the site content ongoing? (If that person is not involved in this process now, they should be when we sign and start the strategy phase.)

Who will be maintaining and monitoring the site for security, performance and keeping current with the latest features?
