### Why Should you maintain your WordPress site?

#### Security

Keeping your WordPress Core, Themes and Plugins updated means you have the latest security patches in place, helping to protect your site from malicious attacks. Read more about WordPress Security in this post.

#### Performance

Any active site is currently being updated with new images and content. The way that you add those elements have an impact on load time that will often go unnoticed unless you’re regularly checking. With monthly Performance reports, you’ll always know exactly how your site is performing. 

#### Visibility

With a monthly Website Care report, you can see, at-a-glance, everything that was done to your site that month, and how it’s doing in major categories such as performance, security, uptime, and analytics.

### "Can't I just do this on my own?"

I used to change my own oil. It doesn’t take an ASE certified mechanic to remove a plug and swap out a filter, but it’s messy, and if your like me, it typically happened a few hundred miles after it should have been done.

WordPress is increasingly becoming a stable and user friendly platform for non-developers to manage. If you have the time and discipline to keep your site up-to-date then 9 times out of 10 you should be fine. With our maintenance packages we make sure that it happens weekly, and that it’s successful 10 time out of 10. We have to tools, expertise and systems to make sure it happens right every time.

### What we do

#### Daily

* Back up the site

#### Weekly

* Check for WordPress core updates
* Check for plugin updates
* Check for theme updates
* Run a Google Page Speed Insights test
* Monitor Comments (Delete spam comments)

#### Monthly

* Optimize Database
* Optimize New Content (a healthy site has new content every month)
* Compress/Resize Images
* Insure meta tags and keywords are optimized for the content
* Make sure the article structure is correct (Headings, image alt tags, pull quotes, etc.)
* Insure Videos are embedded and playing correctly
* Check for broken links
* Monitor Crawl Errors, like ‘404 – Page Not Found’
* Review Plugins and make sure all activated plugins are in use, or disable and remove them.
