### Basic
__Customer Profile:__ They're looking for an inexpensive entry into a website that will give them the ability to make basic changes on their own. The content changes once a month, and the page count is around 6-10. They're not looking to be completely unique, so a template is acceptable, as long as the colors, photos, and logo present a site that looks on-brand for them, but won't be winning any awards.

#### What you get:
* 6-10 Page site
* Choose from 10 templates
* Design will be solid, but not custom
* Basic SEO Setup
* WordPress site editable by the client
* 6 Months of hosting & maintenance

__Profile:__ They're looking for something custom and fast, but don't have the budget for a completely custom solution.
