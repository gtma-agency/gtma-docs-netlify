## Basic Approach

|| WordPress with WooCommerce | Static site with Snipcart |
|---|---|---|
| Build Time | 9-12 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| Security | Requires regular maintenance of WordPress, plugins, and themes, as well as template updates that are common with WooCommerce | No Plugins, No Database, Snipcart is a hosted platform that is updated and maintained on PCI compliant infrastructure |
|Number of Products| unlimited (will require more robust hosting as demands on the server increase) | unlimited (able to handle more concurrent users on fewer resources) |
|CMS| Built on the WordPress CMS it has user management and roles built in.| Content is managed in static files on github generally by a developer |
|Performance| Good, but requires more computing resources to run and scale, and will depend on the other plugins used on the site | Blazing fast, even on inexpensive servers |
|SEO| Full control| Full Control |
| Platform Cost | Free for the platform, additional costs will be for add-ons and maintenance | 2% of sales on the plaform. (A cap can be negotiated with SnipCart for high volume sales)|
| Profile | Hands-on DIYer who wants to have control over the content | Entreprenuer who is looking for a marketing partner to build and manage the content, or someone who doesn't update content often.|
| Blogging | Strong. This is what WordPress was made for | Yes, but requires an understanding of Github and Markdown, or a maintenance agreement with GTMA where one of our developers adds the content |
