## What is design?

My favorite quote from the "Godfather of the Web," Jeffrey Zeldman sums it up perfectly. If we don't know what our goals are, what our content is, and what story we're telling, we're just decorating.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it&#39;s decoration.</p>&mdash; zeldman (@zeldman) <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/804159148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2008</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Form and function

Both are required. Everything you see on the page should have a purpose and be done beautifully and elegantly. This starts with a clear strategy, great content, and a vision for what we're trying to accomplish.

## Define the win

How do you know if your site is effective or not? You have to define what winning looks like, and build everything else around that. If you don't know, the design will be unfocused and lack the clarity that the user requires to "win."
