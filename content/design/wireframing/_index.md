## Wireframing Defined

The first step of creating layout and content flow on a page happens in wireframing. Wireframes may start on paper, or in some other format that allows for quick changes and adjustments to match the content flow defined by the client in the sitemap and information archetecture part of the process.

## What we learn from wireframing

Wireframing gives us the very first sense of content flow and heirarchy. In the sitemapping and information archetecture stage we learn about the content that we need for each page, and the priority of the content that aligns with their goals. The intent of the wireframe is to create a flexible envinroment that allows us to identify and resolve design problems quickly before we've spent too much time and energy in the design phase. This will help us determing the placement, size, and even color of various content types that need to be represented on the page.
