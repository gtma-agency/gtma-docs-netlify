## High fidelity wireframing defined

High Fidelity wireframes include as much final or "working" content as we have at the time. They are interactive, and begin to show the layout, user flow, and look and feel of the site. For simpler site, this will be the final phase of design before going into development.

## The purpose of high fidelity wireframes

1. Begin to show the client what the working site or app will feel like
2. Validate the user flow, and facilitate initial user testing
3. Communicate interaction to the developers
