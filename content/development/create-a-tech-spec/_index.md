1. Make a copy of the Tech Spec Template in the Web Division/Project folder
2. Rename with the project name
3. Add a project overview

{{<notice info>}}
The overview should describe the project's purpose in broad terms. It should mention any unique features, goals or functionality that the site might have. Ecommerce, membership, API integrations would all be good things to mention here.
{{</notice>}}

4. Add the XD link
   * At this point the XD should have been prepped for development according to the [Design-Dev Handoff SOP](/web-division/design-dev-handoff/).
5. Add Dev Server URL - << abbreviated project name>>.gtma.dev
   * The development team will [create the dev server according to the SOP](/web-division/dev-server-setup/)
6. Add fonts package link, font names or other relevant licensing information so the developer has access to the correct fonts for the project.
7. Link to Sitemap. This should have been created at the stategy stage of the project and should be a google sheet in the Web Division/Projects folder for this project. If it's a Real Estate site we can use a generic site map that applies to all sites of that type.
8. Add the name of the theme we will use. If it's a custom theme that we're building, then list that here. It may take the input of a developer or the Director of Web to answer this.
9. List any Plugins that will be needed on the site, especially any premium plugins that we need the client to purchse in order to build site in staging.
10. List all of the page template that the developer will need to build
11. List any Custom Post Types or Custom Taxonomies required in the site
